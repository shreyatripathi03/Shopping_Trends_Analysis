# Shopping_Trends_Analysis
## Overview
Analyzing shopping trends data using Python can provide valuable insights for businesses and retailers to make informed decisions. Below is a project description that outlines the key steps and components of a shopping trends data analysis project using Python. Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze shopping trends based on historical data to identify patterns, preferences, and potential opportunities for businesses and retailers.
## Dataset
- Source: The dataset used in this analysis is available on kaggle. You can access it [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset.)
- Columns:The dataset includes various columns such as Customer ID,Age,Gender,Item Purchase,Category,Purchase Amount (USD) and more.
## Features
### Data Collection:- 
I had acquired a dataset containing relevant shopping data. This could include information such as purchase history, customer demographics, product details, and transaction timestamps. this is a csv file.
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 
The data cleaning process is one of the most important step in data analytics where we actually clean the data according to our requirement. This includes Following steps such as:
-Handle missing or incomplete data.
-Convert data types if needed.
-Remove duplicates.
-Standardize and normalize data.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Here, I had Visualized data distribution using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, Explored correlations between different variables. Identified outliers and anomalies. At the end I had mentioned the insights recovered from data so that it can help to take data driven buisiness decisions.
